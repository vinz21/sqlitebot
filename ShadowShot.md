# Upcoming gameplay additions #

  * better character graphics/animations/death-animations for boss, player
  * expand the map size x 2 or x3 and scroll camera to follow player
  * top-down maps could be more graphical overlays for walls/areas instead of the boring tiles I currently have in place - draw a test map and I can turn that into a wall/collision/pathfinding playable map - user submissions welcome

  * add some additional play elements like dropping timed bombs to kill guards(guards would regenerate after a period on map)
  * possibly add musical game element, player hits wandering musical targets to trigger music loops/bonuses
  * player co-op or versus with two camera views
